Questionnaire for Architects

RQ1: Connection Between Architectural Deterioration and Technical Debt

1.From the viewpoint of architecture, how do you see the relationship between an accumulation of technological debt (TD) and architectural decay (AD)?
2.What effect does the choice between monolithic and microservices design have on the rate at which architectural deterioration and technical debt accumulate in your systems?
3.Which architectural patterns, in your opinion, are the most effective in lowering technical debt without sacrificing flexibility and scalability?



RQ2: Measuring Technical Debt and Architectural Smells

4. What role do object-oriented design metrics (LCOM, WMC, CBO) play in your decision-making process for monitoring architectural health?
5. Have you implemented any specific strategies or tools for quantifying architectural smells or technical debt in the system? How do these metrics guide your architectural decisions?
6. How do you evaluate when it's time to refactor or migrate from one architecture to another based on these design metrics?


RQ3: Long-term Effects of Unmanaged TD and AD

7. How does unmanaged technical debt affect the long-term scalability, performance, and maintainability of systems in both monolithic and microservices architectures?
8. Could you provide an example of a system where the accumulation of architectural deterioration led to significant challenges in system performance or user experience?
9. From your architectural perspective, how do you balance the trade-off between adding new features and managing technical debt in the long run?
