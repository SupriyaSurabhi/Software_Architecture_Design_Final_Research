Questionnaire for Architects

1.From the viewpoint of architecture, how do you see the relationship between an accumulation of technological debt (TD) and architectural decay (AD)?

There is a close connection between architectural decay (AD) and technological debt (TD). AD results from the accumulation of technical debt, which can be brought on by hurried development, a lack of refactoring, or neglected maintenance. This occurs because it becomes more difficult to scale or alter the architecture's structure without incurring large expenses as debt accumulates. This deterioration over time shows up as a greater chance of system failures, a decrease in modularity, and an increase in complexity. Essentially, TD speeds up AD by restricting the system's flexibility and scalability by making it more inflexible and challenging to evolve.

2.What effect does the choice between monolithic and microservices design have on the rate at which architectural deterioration and technical debt accumulate in your systems?

The decision between microservices and monolithic architectures has a big impact on how quickly technical debt and architectural degradation occur. Because the codebase of monolithic systems is closely connected, technical debt tends to mount up more quickly. When one component of the system is altered, it frequently causes cascading problems in other components, increasing complexity and hastening degradation. In contrast, teams may isolate and manage technological debt at the service level with microservices, which provide more modularity. They do, however, present certain difficulties, such as the requirement to manage data consistency, inter-service communication, and distributed systems, which, if not handled appropriately, can also result in architectural degradation. 

3.Which architectural patterns, in your opinion, are the most effective in lowering technical debt without sacrificing flexibility and scalability?

A number of architectural patterns preserve flexibility and scalability while reducing technical debt. Domain-Driven Design (DDD), which encourages segmenting the system into clearly defined bounded contexts, is one useful paradigm. This reduces tight coupling and slows down the building of technical debt by encouraging teams to develop features separately within certain settings. Microkernel architecture is another helpful style that permits flexibility by preserving a stable core system while permitting plug-in components to develop separately. In addition to encouraging worry separation, the Layered Architecture Pattern lowers the likelihood of architectural degradation by allowing layers to change independently of one another. Lastly, by separating read and write operations, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) can aid in system scaling effectively and result in a more manageable architecture.




4. What role do object-oriented design metrics (LCOM, WMC, CBO) play in your decision-making process for monitoring architectural health?

To keep an eye on the health of an architecture, object-oriented design metrics such as CBO (Coupling Between Objects), WMC (Weighted Methods per Class), and LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) are essential. LCOM indicates the need for reworking to increase modularity by assisting in the identification of classes with low cohesion. WMC gauges a class's complexity; a high value can suggest that the class is overworking itself and potentially represent a stumbling block to future advancements or scalability. The degree of coupling between classes is reflected in CBO, and if it is too high, there is a greater chance that modifications will have unintended consequences and cause architectural degradation. Architects can identify early indicators of technical debt and architectural problems by routinely tracking these KPIs, which enables them to take corrective action before these become critical.

5. Have you implemented any specific strategies or tools for quantifying architectural smells or technical debt in the system? How do these metrics guide your architectural decisions?

Yes, I have used a number of techniques to measure technical debt and architectural odors. Real-time feedback on metrics like LCOM, WMC, and CBO is provided by tools like SonarQube, CodeClimate, and CAST Highlight, which provide insights into the quality of code. Early in the development process, these techniques assist in identifying architectural smells like strong coupling, low cohesion, or excessive complexity. We may prioritize refactoring efforts where technical debt is building up the fastest by using these indicators to inform design decisions. To keep the system maintainable, for example, we might choose to disconnect modules if the CBO shows a strong coupling between them. 


6. How do you evaluate when it's time to refactor or migrate from one architecture to another based on these design metrics?

Design metrics and business requirements are frequently used to determine whether to refactor or switch to a new architecture. For example, it might be time for a refactor to increase modularity and lower technical debt if LCOM values are high across several classes, indicating weak cohesion. Similarly, it may indicate that the design has to change if WMC is high in some classes, making them challenging to maintain or expand. When the current architecture is preventing business agility or no longer satisfies scalability or performance needs because of accumulated debt, migration may be taken into consideration. By giving quantitative proof of the locations of architectural deterioration, metrics assist in guiding these decisions and enable us to convince stakeholders that change is necessary.

7. How does unmanaged technical debt affect the long-term scalability, performance, and maintainability of systems in both monolithic and microservices architectures?

The long-term scalability, performance, and maintainability of systems—whether monolithic or microservices-based—are all negatively impacted by unmanaged technological debt. High technological debt in monolithic systems results in a bloated codebase that is challenging to grow and maintain. As the system expands, performance deteriorates, and because of the interdependencies among components, adding new features takes a lot of work. Unmanaged debt in microservices can result in problems managing service dependencies, data inconsistencies, and ineffective inter-service communication. Both architectures eventually experience problems that impact long-term scalability and performance, such as shorter development cycles, higher defect rates, and trouble adjusting to new needs.




8. Could you provide an example of a system where the accumulation of architectural deterioration led to significant challenges in system performance or user experience?
A sizable e-commerce platform with a monolithic architecture was one example I came across. The codebase grew increasingly interconnected over time, with different subsystems such as user identification, payment processing, and inventory management being intricately linked. As a result, the system became slower as additional features were introduced, and performance degraded during peak hours. Scaling individual components was difficult due to the lack of modularity, and any changes might have an impact on the system as a whole. Because developers spent too much time fixing performance bottlenecks and reworking old code, this led to a poor user experience during periods of high traffic and delayed the introduction of new features.


9. From your architectural perspective, how do you balance the trade-off between adding new features and managing technical debt in the long run?
Maintaining technical debt while developing new features is a difficult task that calls for ongoing attention to detail. By taking a proactive stance, scheduling refactoring time in each sprint, and utilizing metrics to pinpoint the regions with the most debt, I give technical debt management top priority. Although new features are crucial, feature development and system performance will eventually suffer if the system's basis is insecure as a result of accrued technical debt. I support ongoing architectural investment, making sure that debt is dealt with gradually rather than letting it mount to an unmanageable level. By incorporating technical debt management into the product development cycle, a balance may be achieved and each new feature added without making matters worse.
